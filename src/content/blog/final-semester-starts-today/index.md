Once again I find myself at the start of another semester. If all goes
according to plan, this should be my last semester at San Jose State. For the
next 4 months or so, I will be putting all my focus on completing my capstone
project. My team and I will be working on four unique models for obstacle
avoidance... It is sure to be doozy.

Over the break, I applied to a number of jobs for when I graduate. To quote the
responses I got, unfortunately ~~we~~ I could not proceed further. This is not
ideal, but I will continue to apply for jobs and hope I will be able to land a
job before May this year.

That is all I have for now, see you all later.
