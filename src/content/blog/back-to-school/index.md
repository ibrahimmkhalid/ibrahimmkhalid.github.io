This week marks the beginning of the third semester of my Master's program at
San Jose State University. We are getting so close to graduating, God-willing.

In the past 2 semesters I worked on my foundations for machine learning and
artificial intelligence by studying various topics from math to databases to
PySpark ot basic ML models. This semester I will _deep_ diver deep learning and
_dig_ deeper with data mining (puns intended). The biggest change this semester
is that I will officially start working on my "Culminating experience", a
single end-to-end ML/AI project over the course of this semester and the next.

What does this mean for my side projects and this blog. The pace at which I put
out blogs or add to my side projects will slow down. My hope is that they do
not slow down by much, but I cannot say for sure at this time. That's all for now.
