# Hello World!

\*_Look, he said the thing_\*

...

Anyways, Hello there! My name is Ibrahim and I am writing this blog just to
establish some sort of online presence. I have been a bit of a lurker in the
tech world only to my detriment. To change that I am going to start this blog.

Will it be succeful, who knows. Will it be consistent, probably not. Will it
contain info about whatever random tech related stuff I will do, definetly.

I have a couple of small project you can check out with varying degrees of
coolness.

1. [Keyboard stuff](https://github.com/ibrahimmkhalid/ibkbd)
2. [Personal dot files](https://github.com/ibrahimmkhalid/dotFiles)
3. [LLM from scratch](https://github.com/ibrahimmkhalid/llm-from-scratch)

That's it, that's the post. Hope you stick around to see what I will be up to
in the near future.
